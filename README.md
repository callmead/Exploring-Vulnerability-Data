# Exploring-Vulnerability-Data-
Our main goal with this project is to extract attack information (kind of attack) from each document and classify new vulnerability reports according to the attack class they belong to. However, because this data isn't labeled, we'll have to experiment with various ways to find distinct clusters/topics within the dataset.
